PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:

1. You have a Rotated Sorted Array with N DISTINCT Elements
2. You have key X
3. Your task is to SEARCH for X in the Rotated Sorted Array and RETURN the index
4. If X doesn't exist RETURN -1


WHY STANDARD BINARY SEARCH WON'T WORK?

-> Because I don't have a completely sorted array of N elements rather I've a Rotated Sorted Array where the elements from index 0 to (n-1) aren't completely sorted.


THOUGHT PROCESS:

1. Searching for index in a SORTED DATASET -> BINARY SEARCH (MODIFIED)
2. As the array isn't completely sorted, hence after calculating the MID I have to identify a SORTED HALF (either left or right half)
3. Once I get a SORTED HALF I need to check if X exists within the SORTED HALF
4. If exists then eliminate the other half


NOTES:
1. The logic will be changed accordingly if the DATASET is sorted in DESCENDING order
2. The following algorithm WON'T WORK if the Rotated Sorted Array contains DUPLICATES -> See Rotated-Sorted-Array-II.py

def searchingRotatedSortedArray(arr, key):
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1

    while (low <= high):
        mid = (low+high)//2
        if (arr[mid] == key):
            return mid
        elif (arr[low] <= arr[mid]):
            if (arr[low] <= key and key <= arr[mid]):
                high = mid - 1
            else:
                low = mid + 1
        else:
            if (arr[mid] <= key and key <= arr[high]):
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid - 1
    
    return -1
