PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:

1. You have a Rotated Sorted Array (Might Contain DUPLICATES)
2. You have key X
3. Your task is to determine whether X is in the Array or not


WHY Rotated-Sorted-Array-I.py WON'T WORK?

-> Because, there is a perticular type of corner case that can't be handled by the previous searching algo. For instance, take [3, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3] or [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 2, 3]. Here, for 1st iteration low=0, high=n-1, mid = 4. Now A[low] = A[mid] = A[high] = 3. Hence, I can't correctly identify which half is actually SORTED HALF. But if i can somehow modify the previous solution such that it can handle this case as well then I'm done.


THOUGHT PROCESS:

1. Searching for index in a SORTED DATASET -> BINARY SEARCH (MODIFIED)
2. Calculate MID. If A[MID] == Key, RETURN True
3. If not, I need to check if A[low] = A[mid] = A[high]. If so, I trim down the search space by low = low + 1 and high = high - 1. Beacuse as MID isn't the key and all three are equal hence current low and high is also not the key.
4. After this I have to identify a SORTED HALF (either left or right half)
3. Once I get a SORTED HALF I need to check if X exists within the SORTED HALF
4. If exists then eliminate the other half


NOTES:
1. The logic will be changed accordingly if the DATASET is sorted in DESCENDING order
