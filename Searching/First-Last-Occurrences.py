PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:

1. You have a SORTED DATASET (Won't work for UNSORTED DATASET)
2. You have an integer X
3. Your task is to find the first & last occurrence of X in the SORTED ARRAY
4. If X is not present in the array then the first & last occurrence will be -1


THOUGHT PROCESS:

1. I'm basically searching for some index in a SORTED DATASET -> So, BINARY SEARCH TYPE
2. Observing more carefully, the first occurrence is basically the LowerBound(X) IFF LowerBound(X) == X
3. If LowerBound(X) != X || LowerBound(X) == Size then actually X doesn't exist in the SORTED DATASET
4. If LowerBound(X) doesn't exist, the first & last occurrence both is -1
5. If first occurrence exists then the last occurrence also exists
6. Observing carefully, the last occurrence is basically the UpperBound(X) - 1


NOTES:
1. The logic will be changed accordingly if the DATASET is sorted in DESCENDING order
