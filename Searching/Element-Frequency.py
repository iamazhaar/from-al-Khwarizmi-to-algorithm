PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:

1. You have a SORTED DATASET (Won't work for UNSORTED DATASET)
2. You have an integer X
3. Your task is to find the number of occurrences of X in the SORTED ARRAY
4. If X is not present in the array then the number of occurrences = 0


THOUGHT PROCESS:

1. I need to find the first & last occurrence of X first
2. Then the number of occurrences of X is: (last-first)+1
3. Similar to the previous problems I have solved -> First-Last-Occurrences.py or Bound-Search.py
4. But here I'm gonna solve it by finding the first occurrence of X using BINARY SEARCH
5. Then I'm find the last occurrence of X using BINARY SEARCH
6. RETURN the number of occurrences = lastOccurrence - firstOccurrence + 1


NOTES:
1. The logic will be changed accordingly if the DATASET is sorted in DESCENDING order
