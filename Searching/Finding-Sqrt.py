PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:

1. You have a integer N
2. You have to find out the sqrt(N) without the help of any built-in functions
3. RETURN an INTEGER that is the sqrt(N)


BRUTE FORCE ALGORITHM -> TC = O(n), SC = O(1)

THOUGHT PROCESS:
1. Start checking from i=0 to i=N as sqrt(N) >= 0 and sqrt(N) <= N
2. Initialize an ANSWER variable
3. CHECK each i whether i*i <= N and if it is update the ANSWER variable
4. RETURN i when the loop ends

def LinearSearchToFindSqrt(n):
    ans = -1
    for i in range(n+1):
        if (i*i <= n):
            ans = i
        else:
            break                       # [As a programmer I optimized the algorithm by adding this else block]
    
    return ans

OPTIMIZED BRUTE FORCE ALGORITHM -> TC = O(sqrt(n)), SC = O(1)

THOUGHT PROCESS:
1. Instead of running a FOR loop and checking each values we can run a WHILE loop with i*i<=n condition
2. Initialize i=0
3. As the loop exits RETURN i-1

'''

def OptimizedLinearSearchToFindSqrt(n):
    i = 0
    while (i*i <= n):
        i += 1
    
    return i - 1

THE MOST EFFICIENT SOLUTION -> THOUGHT PROCESS:

1. We know the searching range [0, N] -> BINARY SEARCH ON ANSWERS type problem
2. We find the MID of the range and try to eliminate either the leftmost half or the rightmost half
3. As a result the search space will get reduced at each iterative step
4. If MID*MID > N then we know for sure the ANSWER we're looking for is in the leftmost part
5. Hence we can eliminate the rightmost part
6. If MID*MID <= N then it might be my answer, put it in the ANSWER variable and eliminate the leftmost part
7. RETURN ANSWER at the end
