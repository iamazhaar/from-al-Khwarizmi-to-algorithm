PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:

1. You have a SORTED DATASET (Won't work for UNSORTED DATASET)
2. You have an integer X
3. You have to find the LOWER & UPPER BOUND of X in the given DATASET
4. RETURN the POSITIONS


DEFINITION OF LOWER & UPPER BOUND:

FOR ASCENDING ORDER SORTED DATASET
-> Lower Bound is the SMALLEST INDEX such that A[i] >= X
-> Upper Bound is the SMALLEST INDEX such that A[i] > X

FOR DESCENDING ORDER SORTED DATASET
-> Lower Bound is the SMALLEST INDEX such that A[i] <= X
-> Upper Bound is the SMALLEST INDEX such that A[i] < X


THOUGHT PROCESS:

1. Think of the Binary Search algorithm
2. But here we're not just looking for the particular index of X rather we're looking for the SMALLEST INDEX of X
3. Hence we initialize ANS variable and UPDATE it accordingly
4. But if X is greater then the largest element in the DATASET then the BOUND will be the last HYPOTHETICAL INDEX = SIZE
5. So initialize ANS = SIZE of the DATASET and UPDATE it accordingly
6. RETURN the ANS variable


NOTES:
1. The logic will be changed accordingly if the DATASET is sorted in DESCENDING order
